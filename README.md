# FRC code
This is the code that I wrote for FRC 2022. It is extremely basic and uses their provided libraries heavily, but I was able to implement Mecanum drive, and what's not pictured here is all of the
struggles I went through to actually figure out how to interface with a roboRIO onboard computer, and how to deal with the network connection failures we constantly got.
